## Uses 

I mainly use my machine to take nodes, write Golang code and manage / develop Kubernetes and networking related things.


Multiple machines and their boot drives, network settings, screen res, installed packages and fonts, key binds and even their wallpapers are configured using this repo. 

A big thank you to everyone who has ever contributed to the packages I use :).
